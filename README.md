Sunless Sea Mod : CNL London Warehouse
======================================

About
-----
This Sunless Sea mod adds a purchasable warehouse to Fallen London to store items via the shop interface.

This is an unofficial fan work. 

Fallen London and Sunless Sea are © 2015 and ™ Failbetter Games Limited: www.failbettergames.com

The artwork included with this mod is from Sunless Sea and should only be used with a licensed copy of Sunless Sea.

Installation
------------
Extract the contents of the zip file and copy the cnl-warehouse folder to your addons folder.
It should end up looking like SunlessSea/addon/cnl-warehouse/entities etc. 

Then copy the images in inside SunlessSea/addon/cnl-warehouse/images to SunlessSea/images/sn/icons/

(the addons mechanism doesn't currently support images inside the /addon folder)


Removal
-------
To remove this mod, just delete the cnl-warehouse folder from within the /addons folder.
You will want to remove any stored items first unless you don't mind losing them.

Usage
-----
The mod adds a new menu item in Fallen London : Wolfstack Docks

From the Wolfstack Docks menu you can buy or sell your warehouse.

You can also "activate" the warehouse - this will hide the regular shops and instead show your warehouse.

You can re-activate the regular shops from the Wolfstack Docks menu (alternatively, leaving London and re-docking will also restore the regular shops).
